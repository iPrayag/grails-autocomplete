This is a bash script (originally written by Fernando Takai) that allows auto-completion of grails commands from the command line. Basically extending the bash-like auto-completion functionality to include grails commands.

STEP 1 :

To use it you have to have gawk (it's default on some linux distros -- but on mac, you have to install trough mac ports)

STEP 2 :
ALT 1

sudo cp Downloads/grails-autocomplete/grails_autocomplete /etc/bash_completion.d/

ALT 2

Ensure bash_completition is enabled in /.bashrc
# enable programmable completion features (you don't need to enable
# this, if it's already enabled in /etc/bash.bashrc and /etc/profile
# sources /etc/bash.bashrc).
if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ] && ! shopt -oq posix; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
fi


To start using it you need to add this:
[ -r /path/to/the/file ] && source /path/to/the/file

To the top of your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile scripts.

STEP 3 :

For your changes to take affect you must open a new shell or re-login to your current shell (su - your_user).

<b>USE IT</b>

To use it, just go your grails project and try:
grails list<tab>
grails create<tab><tab>
grails create-a<tab><tab>
